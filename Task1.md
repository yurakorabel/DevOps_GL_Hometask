- **ISP** - 34 $ * 12 = 408 $
- **Charging station** - 1650 $
- **Electricity consumption** - 370 $
- **Server maintenance** - 220 $

### **Comparsion**
A home web server costs us $4,400, while AWS costs $3,490. We can see that AWS is $910 cheaper. And in this case, the use of cloud technologies will be several times more reliable.
